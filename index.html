								<h2>Social justice poster</h2>
								<p>This poster was made to fight for the well being of the world and to let people know what thier pollution actually does to the environment. I believe that many people dont know thier part in the world and how every little ting they do can affect another organism. This poster is mainly designed to educate people and open thier minds to the topic of pollution using a nice manner.</p>

								<h2>Park sign poster</h2>
								<p>This park sign was made to intrigue people and give them the idea of coming to the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed hasn't been doing too good visitors-wise even though the views and park is amazing. The poster was mad to get people intrigued and want to visit.</p>
